# Video Support

## Development

### Intercom

To test all intercom interactions locally, the following setup is required.

**1. NGROK Proxy Instance**\
Start a `ngrok` instance with the following command `ngrok http --region=eu <the port you're running on || 3000>`.

Next, go to your `env.development` file and swap the `PUBLIC_URL=https://76ca460b81bb.ngrok.io` with the generated one.

**2. Change Canvas Kit Urls**\
In order to make use of the Test app locally, copy and paste the `PUBLIC_URL` [here](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/v49cmmug/developer-hub/app-packages/69125/canvas-kit):
Section: `For users, leads and visitors`

1. Initialize flow webhook URL
2. Submit flow webhook URL

**3. Intercom Demo**\
Go to the demo page [here](https://app.videosupport.io/demo):
Fill in the following workspaceId `v49cmmug`. Subject the form and you'll see the bubble apear in the bottom right corner.

**4. Add Test Space Access Token**\
Set the following variables in your `.env.development`:

- `INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `COOKIE_SESSION_KEY` (choose any key)
- `JWT_SECRET_ZENDESK` (must be the same as Zendesk repository)

You can find the **Access Token** on [this page](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/v49cmmug/developer-hub/app-packages/69125/oauth).

**5. Start Client & Server**\
After setting and generating a Proxy, start your development servers. This injects the right NODE_ENVs in the project.
See the [scripts section](#scripts).

**6. Refresh the Widget**\
Visit the [Messenger](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/v49cmmug/messengers) Page of the test dashboard. Open the **Add apps to your Messenger** dropdown.
You can choose to add the widget for a visitor or user.

### Zendesk

To test all zendesk interactions locally, the following setup is required.

**1. Go to the Zendesk dashboard**\
Via this [ðŸ”— link](https://d3v-videosupport5562.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard?zat=true).
Add `?zat=true` at the end of any url detects that you're in developing mode.

All zendesk related start-up commands, you can find via the [github repo](https://github.com/FrencisAlreadyInUse/videosupport-zendesk).

ðŸš€ You're set! Happy coding.

## Development

### Git practices

1. Use conventional commit messages (https://conventionalcommits.org)
2. Keep the git history clean (no merge commits) and linear, by rebasing a branch before merging. If one were to create a PR to merge the branch `example` into `dev`, one could do:

```bash
# make sure `dev` is up to date, pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin dev:dev

# go to `example` branch and rebase
git checkout example
git rebase -i dev

# in the next screen, one can squash, pick, drop etc commits as needed
# if there are any conflicts, use `git mergetool` to solve them (might require to install meld)
# after it's rebased, do
git push -f origin example

# then `example` can be merged into `dev`, through the github UI or command line, like below
git checkout dev
git merge example
git push origin dev
```

### Environment

Duplicate the `.env.environment.example` file and rename the copy to `.env.development`.

Like the name suggest, `.env.development` holds the variables used during development.\
This counts for `npm run server:dev` and `npm run client:dev`.

### Scripts

There are two main scripts you need to run the project

| Script               | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run server:dev` | Run the server and start watching for file changes to recompile. |
| `npm run client:dev` | Start parcel.js bundler.                                         |

```

If `clientId` is throwing an error, regenerate on the contact in Intercom

## Production

### Environment

Duplicate the `.env.environment.example` file and rename the copy to `.env.production`.

Like the name suggest, `.env.production` holds the variables used during production.\

Keep in mind though that no `.env.*` files are pushed to git.\
This means that if you deploy to Heroku, the production variables need to be set in Heroku's dashboard.\
Since `npm run build` is triggered on heroku, the `.env.production` file has no use locally and will not even be used by the server.\
The client part _will_ however use this file if you run `npm run client:build` locally for debugging purposes.

## Heroku

To check logs, type

`heroku logs --tail --remote staging`

Switch `staging` for `heroku` to check production

## Problem with the app! Now what?

If the app has a problem in production, which was introduced in a new deployment, you can first try to return the app to a previous state. To do that, check the git tags by typing in the terminal

```bash
git tag -l
```

This will list all the existing tags in the repository. The tags marked with `-prod` are commits which were deployed to production. So if the output of `git tag -l` is

```
v0.3-prod
v0.2-prod
v0.2-prod
```

Currently, the version in production is `v0.3-prod`, so you can go back to `v0.2-prod` and deploy it to try to fix the issue. Do that with:

```bash
git push --force heroku v0.2-prod:master
```
